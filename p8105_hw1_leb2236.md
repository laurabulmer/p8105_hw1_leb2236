# Problem 1

I installed the package containing the penguin dataset and will now load
the penguin dataset.

``` r
data("penguins", package = "palmerpenguins")
```

#### Description of the Penguins dataset

The dataset penguins contains data regarding observed penguins.

The 8 variables included in the dataset are species of penguin
(‘species’), island (‘island’), bill length in mm (‘bill_length_mm’),
bill depth in mm (‘bill_depth_mm’), flipper length in mm
(‘flipper_length_mm’), body mass in grams (‘body_mass_g’), sex, and
year.

In this dataset, there are 344 rows/observations and 8 columns. The mean
flipper length is 200.9152047.

#### Scatterplot of flipper length vs bill length

I used the code below to generate the scatter plot and then to save it
as a pdf to the directory.

``` r
ggplot(penguins, aes(
  x = bill_length_mm, 
  y = flipper_length_mm,
  color = species)) + geom_point()
```

    ## Warning: Removed 2 rows containing missing values or values outside the scale range
    ## (`geom_point()`).

``` r
ggsave("scatter_plot.pdf", height = 4, width = 6)
```

    ## Warning: Removed 2 rows containing missing values or values outside the scale range
    ## (`geom_point()`).

# Problem 2

#### Creating the data frame

The code below is used to create a data frame.

``` r
homework_df = tibble(
  sample = rnorm(10),
  log_vec = sample > 0,
  char_vec = c("a", "b", "c", "d", "e", "f", "g", "h", "i", "j"),
  factor_vec = factor(c("low", "low", "low", "low", "low", "medium", "medium",
                        "medium", "high", "high"))
)
```

#### Taking the mean of each variable

``` r
mean(pull(homework_df, sample))
```

    ## [1] -0.131427

``` r
mean(pull(homework_df, log_vec))
```

    ## [1] 0.4

``` r
mean(pull(homework_df, char_vec))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(homework_df, char_vec)): argument is not numeric
    ## or logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

``` r
mean(pull(homework_df, factor_vec))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(homework_df, factor_vec)): argument is not numeric
    ## or logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

We are able to take the mean of the sample and the logical vector, but
not the character or factor vectors.

#### Applying the as.numeric function

``` r
as.numeric(pull(homework_df,log_vec))
as.numeric(pull(homework_df,char_vec))
```

    ## Warning: NAs introduced by coercion

``` r
as.numeric(pull(homework_df,factor_vec))
```

Applying the as.numeric function to these variables had different
outcomes.

- The logical vector was successfully converted, which makes sense as we
  were able to take the mean.
- The character vector was converted to NAs, which also makes sense as
  we couldn’t take the mean for that variable.
- The factor vector was coverted, however the numbers don’t make sense
  with the levels that were set. Given we weren’t able to take the mean,
  I wasn’t expecting the numeric conversion to work well.It appears they
  were converted based on the alphabetical order of the levels set.
