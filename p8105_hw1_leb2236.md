# Problem 1

I installed the package containing the penguin dataset and will now load
the penguin dataset.

``` r
data("penguins", package = "palmerpenguins")
```

#### Description of the Penguins dataset

The dataset penguins contains data regarding observed penguins.

The 8 variables included in the dataset are species of penguin
(‘species’), island (‘island’), bill length in mm (‘bill_length_mm’),
bill depth in mm (‘bill_depth_mm’), flipper length in mm
(‘flipper_length_mm’), body mass in grams (‘body_mass_g’), sex, and
year.

In this dataset, there are 344 rows/observations and 8 columns. The mean
flipper length is 200.9152047.

#### Scatterplot of flipper length vs bill length

We will use the code below to generate the scatter plot and then to save
it as a pdf to our directory.

``` r
ggplot(penguins, aes(
  x = bill_length_mm, 
  y = flipper_length_mm,
  color = species)) + geom_point()
```

    ## Warning: Removed 2 rows containing missing values or values outside the scale range
    ## (`geom_point()`).

```

# Problem 2

#### Creating the data frame

``` r
homework_df = tibble(
  sample = rnorm(10),
  log_vec = sample > 0,
  char_vec = c("a", "b", "c", "d", "e", "f", "g", "h", "i", "j"),
  factor_vec = factor(c("low", "low", "low", "low", "low", "medium", "medium",
                        "medium", "high", "high"))
)
```
