# Problem 1

I installed the package containing the penguin dataset and will now load
the penguin dataset.

``` r
data("penguins", package = "palmerpenguins")
```

#### Description of the Penguins dataset

The dataset penguins contains data regarding observed penguins.

The 8 variables included in the dataset are species of penguin
(‘species’), island (‘island’), bill length in mm (‘bill_length_mm’),
bill depth in mm (‘bill_depth_mm’), flipper length in mm
(‘flipper_length_mm’), body mass in grams (‘body_mass_g’), sex, and

In this dataset, there are 344 rows/observations and 8 columns. The mean
